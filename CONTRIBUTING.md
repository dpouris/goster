# Contributing to Goster

Thank you for considering contributing to Goster! I appreciate your support and interest in making Goster better. Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- **Search existing issues** to see if the bug has already been reported.
- If not, create a new issue with detailed information:
  - A clear and descriptive title.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Expected and actual behavior.
  - Screenshots or logs if applicable.

### Feature Requests
- **Search existing feature requests** to avoid duplicates.
- If your idea is new, create an issue with:
  - A clear and descriptive title.
  - Detailed description of the proposed feature.
  - Any relevant use cases or examples.

### Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Include tests for your changes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting.
- Submit a pull request with a clear title and description of your changes.

### Improving Documentation
Currently, there's no documentation as there's not a need for it. Goster is still a small package that is "self-documented" in a way but in the future I will most likely look into it.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dpouris/goster
   cd goster
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```
